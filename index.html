          <p>Donald Trump doesn’t have the vote or support of most Indian Americans, but they do concede that his presence at a New Jersey rally in October marked a watershed moment for them.</p>
          
          <p>It was the first time that a US presidential nominee had made a direct pitch to them, bowl in hand, acknowledging the growing clout of America’s wealthiest and best educated ethnic group.</p>
          
          <p>Hillary Clinton, his rival, hadn’t made a matching bid, but she remembered to extend Diwali greetings to the community, and so did Evan McMullin, the independent hoping to draw away conservatives from Trump.</p>
          
          <p> And the Republican nominee’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, attended a Diwali function in Virginia, a swing state, to which Indian Americans held the key because of changing demographics.</p>
         
          <p> It’s turning out to be quite an election for the community. There have never been so many Indian-Americans in the race for the Congress, past the primaries: six, including, Kamala Harris for senate, and the five – Ami Bera, Ro Khanna, Pramila Jaypal, Raja Krishnamoorthi and Peter Jacob – for the House of Representatives.</p>
         
          <p>Moreover, the rest of the community has not exactly been on the sidelines, cheering quietly. They are out there raising money, organising events and displaying a mobilisation that has never been seen before.“This is really a historic year for Indian Americans,” Shekar Narasimhan, a Democratic strategist and a top fundraiser for Clinton, said, adding, “and a coming of age for the community.”</p>
          
          <p>Shalli Kumar, the Chicago businessman who founded the Republican Hindu Coalition that staged the Trump event in New Jersey, has also emerged as one of the most generous donors from the Indian-American community. He is said to have spent millions in direct contributions to the presidential and congressional campaigns, plus expenses on events.</p>
          
          <p> And some Indian-Americans also hold top positions in the presidential campaigns– at least in Clinton’s campaign. Neera Tanden, a long-time Clinton aide and policy adviser to President Barack Obama, is one of the four co-chairs of Clinton’s transition team; and Mini Thimmaraju heads Clinton’s outreach to women.</p>

          <p>They’ve come a long way from Dalip Singh Saund, the first Indian American to have even made it to the top echelons of politics in the US: he was the first member from the community to have been elected to the House of Representatives in 1956.</p>

In 1953, he ran for the same post and won. By 1955, Saund started considering running for the Congress as a Democrat and won the party nomination, and the election.</p>

But in 2015, he didn’t make it past the primaries, swept aside by Donald Trump.</p>
